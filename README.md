Module 6 Challenge

In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator using the citipy Python libraryLinks to an external site., and the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site to create a representative model of weather across cities.

Then I determined the best places for me to vacation based off my weather preferences, found the nearest hotel to those cities, and displayed all of that on a map. 

The saved plots are located in the 'Visuals' folder, the analysis for both sections is located in the 'Analysis' folder, and the CSV file is located in the 'Resources' folder. The discussions on the linear relationships are located in the WeatherPy.ipynb. 

For some reason, the maps in the VacationPy section do not show up on the preview in GitHub. Hopefully thats normal, because I can see them fine in my jupyter notebook. 


This challenge was difficult at times, but felt great when it all came together. For the WeatherPy section, the part that gave me the most difficulty was honestly just getting the legends to be readable. I had somehwat of an idea of how to move them, but was able to work out the kinks using Stack overflow. 

For the VacationPy section, it all went smoothly until I got to the hotel part. I kept getting no results for hotels around the cities, so I went on Stack overflow and realized that the issue ended up being with the parameters. I had to make the filter and bias f-strings and that seemed to fix the issue I was having. 

Overall it took me longer than I expected but hopefully it turned out pretty well.

Thank you!
